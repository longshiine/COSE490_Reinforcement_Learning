## Contents
### 1. Basic RL
**Goal:** The goal of the first homework is (i) to let the student familiar with the simulator environment, called Open AI Gym, and (ii) to understand the basic programming structure for the RL.
**Task:** Use the provided file, and run the program in there. Understand how one can implement policy evaluation, policy improvement, policy iteration, and value iteration.
- Task 1: Construct program environment to run the provided program (e.g., python, jupyter notebook, and programs for RL and Open AI Gym). The provided file is in the format of “jupyter notebook”

- Task 2: Make the (provided) program run without error.
### 2. Rollout with Frozen Lake
